# Dimitri-Network

I had a chat where I could not give a straight answer about how is a computer found when a request reaches the network. I should have known... but I did not.

The best way to learn is to play around and do it yourself, so I did! Joined my curiosity of Rust with my dumbness of networking protocols and came up with a playground for networks.

@jonhoo who is an absolute __chad__ has an amazing [video series about implementing the TCP protocol with Rust](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqbS7AVVErFivDY3iKAQk3_VAm8SXwt1X&si=QgER0lN5HkhQ_esR) that was my first step for this playground.
